			<h1>Who is a good leader?</h1> By: Nitin Mukesh, BHU
		</div>
		<div class="">
			<h3>
				It is seen many times that a team lead by a good leader often come out with a better outcome than those who are not with a good leader. So, here the difference occurs. One major factor is also motivation that can really be most important features.
			</h3>
			<h3>
				In old days it was said that an army lead by a strong person come with victory. Let's explore this statement. A good leader is that person who understand his team. He actually do most part on any task. The team should have a feeling that someone stronger is there with them and then see the outcome. The team will automatically start doing there best. And when there is lack of self motivation among the team members and they start falling down with their accuracy in work, the leader take his part. He will soon have a great idea to motivate them. This how a team works. Also a good leader try to solve all those problems that make his/her team members worry. Whether it is their general life problem, health issue or any technical issue. Caring is most important part when we deal with a good leader. He do what he say. And everyone trust on him.

					<h3>
						There are a number of cases when due to storng leader their team did a termendous job. The good leaders donot take the whole credit with them. They always try to do it for their team and that is the factor which makes them the most favourite to them. They just feel good in this. Abraham Lincoln was such a great leader. He was really an awesome leader. He led the country in many tough situations and came out with victory. But you should know that he himself failed a lot of times in his life. Anyone just couldn't imagine that how many times he failed and he was always ready to face another one.

			<h3>
				So, if you really want your team to lead to success and do a better work than you should be a good leader. Just don't try to give the team burden but take a lot on yourself. They will be inspired. Only inspiration can take them. Be with them in every situation and try to understand them. They are your team members.
